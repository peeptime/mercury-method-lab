# SPEC.md — GlimpseGate-admission-lab v2.2.0

```yaml
provenance:
  authors: project_owner + Codex
  ai_assisted: true
  human_reviewed: declined

```

> "The purpose of vibe coding is not rapid productivity but code quality."
> — MoAI-ADK motto, adapted: The purpose of GlimpseGate is not rapid memory but auditable memory.

This SPEC defines what v2.2.0 must achieve, what it must not break, and how progress is measured.

---

## 1. Problem Statement

AI agents produce claims at scale. These claims mix:
- Direct facts (from user input)
- Inferences (from AI reasoning)
- Assumptions (unstated premises)
- Preferences (dressed as facts)
- Gaming attempts (inputs designed to manipulate the system)

Without an evidence gate, all of these enter memory with equal authority.

**GlimpseGate-admission-lab solves this** by providing a local, structural audit gate
that runs before durable memory write. It does not judge truth — it judges traceability.

---

## 2. Design Principles

### P1: Evidence over authority
A claim backed by a user-provided source is treated differently from an AI inference.
The system tracks which is which, regardless of how confident the text sounds.

### P2: Routing, not scoring
The system produces routing decisions (`accept`, `revise`, `quarantine`, `discard`).
It does NOT produce numerical scores that can be optimized against.
Blockers are binary signals, not gradients.

### P3: Small, composable, adaptable
Inspired by [mattpocock/skills](https://github.com/mattpocock/skills).
Every skill, function, and configuration can be adapted without touching the core.
Skills are SKILL.md files agents can use directly.

### P4: SPEC-first before implementation
Inspired by [modu-ai/moai-adk](https://github.com/modu-ai/moai-adk).
Every feature starts as a SPEC. Every PR must update the SPEC or justify the deviation.

### P5: Zero external dependencies for the SDK core
The audit SDK (`src/mercury-audit/`) requires only Node.js ≥ 20.
No external LLM calls, no network access, no database.

## 4. Functional Specification

### 4.1 Audit SDK Core

```js
import {
  audit,                    // Text → audit result
  auditMemoryWrite,          // Audit packet → audit result + memory-ready packet
  buildEvidenceChain,        // Packet + result → evidence chain
  buildAdmissionContract,    // Evidence chain + choice → admission contract
  verifyAuditStability,     // Audit result × 2 → fidelity score
  quickStabilityCheck,      // Single audit result → internal consistency
  auditWithStabilityCheck,  // Full fidelity audit with routing downgrade
  applyStabilityGate,       // Stability score → routing decision adjustment
} from '@GlimpseGate/admission-lab'
```

**Constraints:**
- All functions are pure Node.js (no external network calls)
- `audit()` and `auditMemoryWrite()` must return within 50ms for typical inputs
- Fidelity functions must be deterministic (same input → same output)
- Routing decisions must match one of: `accept`, `revise`, `quarantine`, `discard`

### 4.2 Routing Decision Logic

```
Input type           Evidence present?   Confidence high?  → Decision
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
factual claim        yes                  yes               accept
factual claim        no                   —                 quarantine
inference            —                    yes               revise (or accept*)
inference            no                   no                quarantine
assumption           —                    —                 revise
preference-adjacent  —                    —                 revise
gaming attempt       —                    —                 discard
* Only when inference is directly supported by a user-provided source ref
```

### 4.3 Memory Gate Integration

```js
// Pre-write hook (memory-write gate)
const packet = auditMemoryWrite({
  content: aiOutput,
  type: "agent_summary",
  risk_level: "medium",
  source_refs: ["conversation:session-42"],
  audit_refs: ["docs/SCENARIO-PACKS.md"]
});

if (packet.routing_decision === "discard") {
  throw new Error("Memory write blocked: gaming attempt detected");
}
if (packet.routing_decision === "quarantine") {
  await requestHumanReview(packet);
}
writeToMemory(packet);
```

### 4.4 Skill Interface

Every skill is a SKILL.md file that:
1. Describes when to use the skill (trigger conditions)
2. Provides step-by-step instructions
3. Shows concrete before/after examples
4. Links to relevant SPEC.md sections

## 7. Acceptance Criteria

### v2.2.0 Release Gate

- [ ] `npm run test` — all tests pass
- [ ] `npm run doctor` — all checks pass
- [ ] `npm run benchmark:v2` — no regression > 20% vs baseline
- [ ] `npm run validate:incr` — no errors
- [ ] `CONTEXT.md` exists and is referenced by all new skills
- [ ] `SPEC.md` exists and is updated before any feature PR
- [ ] GitHub Releases: v2.1.7 and v2.2.0 both have release notes
- [ ] `CONTEXT.md` and `SPEC.md` are in `.github/CODEOWNERS` or equivalent
- [ ] README.md shows "GlimpseGate-admission-lab" prominently
- [ ] Legacy docs (ITERATION-GUIDE-0.x through 1.2.x) archived

### Performance Regression Prevention

Every commit to `main` triggers:
```
npm run benchmark:v2
→ compare to data/benchmark-baseline.json
→ fail CI if any function regresses > 20%
```

Baseline (v2.1.7, Node.js v22, Apple Silicon):

| Function | Baseline ops/s |
|----------|---------------|
| audit | ~14,000 |
| auditMemoryWrite | ~13,500 |
| buildEvidenceChain | ~12,700 |
| buildAdmissionContract | ~17,700 |
| verifyAuditStability | ~22,800 |
| quickStabilityCheck | ~24,000 |
| full_pipeline | ~17,000 |

## 8. Stop List (enforced)

These are non-negotiable boundaries. Violations require a major version bump.

- ❌ Do NOT add numerical scoring or optimization targets
- ❌ Do NOT add external LLM calls to the audit core
- ❌ Do NOT add database or backend adapters
- ❌ Do NOT publish to npm without a formal integration review
- ❌ Do NOT auto-promote captured conversations to admitted memory
- ❌ Do NOT fabricate source_refs or audit_refs
- ❌ Do NOT present this as OWASP compliance certification
- ❌ Do NOT add AI self-audit or AI-suggested routing features
