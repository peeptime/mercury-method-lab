# Changelog

## Provenance Policy

Every release entry must carry an explicit provenance declaration. Legacy entries that cannot be reconstructed are marked as unverified instead of being silently treated as human-only.

## 2.0.0-alpha.2 - Real Case Foundation (2026-05-10)
> Provenance: `[AI_GENERATED]` drafted_by: Codex; humanReviewed: declined; reviewer: project_owner_pending; audit_ref: docs/REAL-CASES-SUMMARY.md

### Added

- `scripts/build_real_cases.mjs` builds reproducible structured cases under `cases/2026-05/`.
- `scripts/check_real_cases.mjs` validates that each case has input, audit result, review status, and at least one case for each routing decision.
- `docs/REAL-CASES-SUMMARY.md` summarizes 10 local repository cases without pretending they are external human records.
- `examples/integration-demo/openclaw-hook.mjs` simulates an OpenClaw-compatible memory write hook that blocks one unsafe candidate and accepts one scoped candidate.

### Changed

- Release gate now runs case build/check plus the OpenClaw and Starter Kit demos.
- Doctor and cycle checks now recognize the case foundation and integration-demo artifacts.

- Sample indexing excludes generated exports/manifests from reusable memory samples and fills stable sample-type inference.

### Next Candidates

- `1.0.x`: critical bug fixes only.
- `1.1.0`: Codex 5.5 adaptation and MCP server activation if the platform support is real.
- `1.2.0`: plugin system and internationalization if external demand appears.

## 0.9.0 — 从概念声明走向可运行证明（2026-05-04）

> Provenance: `[AI_GENERATED]` drafted_by: Codex; humanReviewed: true; reviewer: project_owner; audit_ref: docs/METHODOLOGY-INTEGRITY.md

### Added

- `docs/v0.9-proof-of-audit.md` — 第一个端到端坏记忆拦截案例，展示审计层如何拦截虚假AI结论，满足IC Memo重开条件"1个真实迁移案例"
- `schemas/audit-export-contract.json` + `schemas/examples/` — Audit Export Contract JSON Schema，3合规+2反例，可被ajv验证

## 0.8.0 — Memory Pre-Audit Contract

> Provenance: `[LEGACY_PROVENANCE_UNKNOWN]` humanReviewed: unknown; reviewer: pending; risk: historical release note predates explicit provenance policy

### Added

- `docs/AUDIT-CONTRACT.md`：明确 Mercury Lab 是长期 Agent Brain 前的 pre-ingestion audit gate，不是 second brain、检索引擎或通用 Skill 框架。
- `config/memory-targets.json`：声明 `markdown`、`mercury_agent`、`gbrain` 三类目标后端，默认只做 export-only handoff，不直接写运行时数据库。
- `scripts/export_memory_bundle.mjs`：新增 `npm run export:memory`、`npm run export:gbrain`、`npm run export:agent`，从 `11_indexes/sample-index.json` 生成 pre-audit bundle。
- `schemas/memory-preaudit-bundle.schema.json`：定义外部 brain 接收前的 bundle 结构。

### Changed

- `README.md` / `README.en.md`：定位更新为“长期 Agent Brain 前置审计闸门”，并补充 gbrain / Mercury Agent / OpenClaw 的接入边界。
- `docs/GOVERNANCE.md`：升级到 v0.4.0，明确 Mercury Lab 不负责 memory graph / retrieval，只负责入脑前判级与迁移许可。
- `scripts/rebuild_index.mjs`：sample index 新增 `intent`、`reminder_intensity`、`feedback_expected_from`、`target_backend`、`stop_condition`、`falsify_condition` 等迁移审计字段。
- `config/integrations.json` 与 `config/memory-architecture.json` 补充 gbrain / Mercury Agent Second Brain 的 export-only 接入说明。

### Performance

- `export_memory_bundle.mjs` 只读 `sample-index.json`，不扫描 artifact 正文，不触发索引重建，不写外部运行时数据库。
- `validate_artifacts.mjs` 改为显式扫描项目关键目录和根文件，避免未来无关大目录拖慢验证。

---

## 0.7.6 — Agent 模式性能护栏

> Provenance: `[LEGACY_PROVENANCE_UNKNOWN]` humanReviewed: unknown; reviewer: pending; risk: historical release note predates explicit provenance policy

### Changed

- `scripts/run_v8_analysis.mjs`：Agent 模式默认不再重建索引，避免 OpenClaw / Agent 在封闭任务包后又触发全量索引扫描；如确实需要，可传 `--index` 或设置 `agent_auto_rebuild_index=true`。
- Agent 任务包中的执行说明改为：只有 `requested_outputs.index` 非空时才运行 `npm run index`，避免默认消耗额外上下文和文件系统预算。
- `config/methods.json` 新增 `auto_rebuild_index` 与 `agent_auto_rebuild_index`，把 API 模式和 Agent 模式的索引策略拆开。

### Performance

- `scripts/validate_artifacts.mjs` 跳过 `.git`、`node_modules`、构建缓存目录，并跳过 2MB 以上的文本类文件，降低仓库增长后的验证成本。
- `scripts/rebuild_index.mjs` 对缺失目录和 2MB 以上文本类文件做安全跳过，减少全量索引在大文件/临时导出上的卡顿风险。

---

## 0.7.5 — `/goal` 输出收口修正

> Provenance: `[LEGACY_PROVENANCE_UNKNOWN]` humanReviewed: unknown; reviewer: pending; risk: historical release note predates explicit provenance policy

### Fixed

- 修复 `goal-validator.mjs` 在验证状态行中间硬插入四关检验与 Judgment Closure，导致 Markdown 渲染错位的问题。
- 生成 action_plan 时会先移除模板中已有的 `四关检验`、`Judgment Closure`、`Next Review` section，再统一追加受控尾部，避免重复注入。
- intent 推断改为“明确时间表达 → immediate，否则 archived”，不再把“尽快”这类弱时间词自动判成 strict reminder。
- 时间维度对 `archived` 改为冷存储通过，避免“无明确时间 → archived”却无法生成 artifact 的逻辑矛盾。

### Changed

- `09_templates/action_plan_template.md` 升级到 schema v0.2，补齐 `intent`、`reminder_intensity`、`feedback_expected_from` 与 Judgment Closure 骨架。
- `feedback_expected_from` 随 action_plan 生成写入 metadata 与 Next Review，保留反馈入口但不转成热提醒。

---

## 0.7.4 — 冷存储原则 + intent 字段落地

> Provenance: `[AI_ASSISTED]` source: "2026-05-04 用户与 AI 协作完成"; humanReviewed: true-by-claim; reviewer: project_owner; audit_ref: docs/METHODOLOGY-INTEGRITY.md

### Added

- `09_templates/action_plan_template.md`（v0.2）：
  - 新增 `intent` 字段（archived / immediate / watchful）
  - 新增 Judgment Closure section（结论摘要 / 弱推荐 / 继续入口）
- `scripts/goal-validator.mjs`：
  - 生成 action_plan 时自动推断 intent：有时间词 → immediate，否则 archived
  - 自动注入 Judgment Closure 骨架
  - intent=archived 时在 Next Review 标注"无需执行跟进"
- `docs/STRATEGIC-RETHINK.md`（v0.3.0）：完整记录本次讨论过程
- `docs/GOVERNANCE.md`（v0.3.0）：新增交互原则、存储原则、intent 分类说明

### Design Notes

- **冷存储，不是热提醒**：用户不推进是正常结束，不需要提醒
- **结论优先，开口次之，推荐要弱**：洞察在那里，给一个清晰结论是最健康的；开口存在但不主动推
- **intent 分类**：archived（洞察存档，无提醒）/ immediate（立即执行，严格提醒）/ watchful（观望，轻提醒）
- **Judgment Closure 优化**：结论摘要直接给出；弱推荐很弱不转移焦点；继续入口存在但不突出

- `npm run index` 现在同时生成 `11_indexes/sample-index.json`，作为样本库的机器可读视图。
- `sample-index.json` 暴露 `sample_type`、`project_id`、`reuse_count`、`reuse_refs`、`feedback_status`、`feedback_refs`、`memory_level`、`confidence` 和 `risk`。
- 样本索引会汇总缺口：未判级、未绑定项目、无复用追踪、决策/行动无反馈。
- SQLite artifact 表同步增加样本判级、项目、复用、反馈和风险字段。

### Changed

- `README.md` / `README.en.md` 增加 source index 与 sample index 的区别。
- `docs/GOVERNANCE.md` 升级到 v0.2.1：样本库索引从“未做”调整为“初版已做”，后续重点转向检索、复用追踪和反馈回填。

## 0.7.0 — 核心定位声明 + 碎片循环问题确认

> Provenance: `[LEGACY_PROVENANCE_UNKNOWN]` humanReviewed: unknown; reviewer: pending; risk: historical release note predates explicit provenance policy

### Changed

- `README.md`：核心定位升级为「面向高频 AI 对话者的洞察样本沉淀系统」，替换旧版「意图识别的保险」定位
- 明确 Mercury Lab 的本质边界：**不是**普通知识库，**不是**通用 AI 审计平台
- 明确核心问题：高价值碎片若不经过目标验证、类型判级、案例绑定、审计记录和复用出口，会变成干净但无用的知识碎片

### Added

- `docs/GOVERNANCE.md`（v0.2.0）：核心目标定义、判级类型表、核心数据流、架构优先级、下一步方向
- `08_skills/SKILL-DESIGN-GUIDE.md`：Skill 最佳实践存档（按需加载 / 渐进式披露 / allowed_tools / trigger_eval / 验证闭环）
- `08_skills/SKILL-AUDIT.md`：项目 Skill 审计报告 + 碎片循环问题发现

### Known Issues（v0.7.0 已知缺失）

- **样本库无索引**：artifact 存在于各目录，但没有检索和相似案例发现机制
- **复用无追踪**：没有引用计数、复用记录和淘汰机制
- **判级无回填**：artifact metadata 中缺少判级类型标签（废料/素材/案例/模板/决策/action/Skill）
- **反馈无入口**：decision_log 和 action_plan 的执行结果没有强制回填机制

## 0.6.0 — `/goal` 照妖镜 + Agent 内嵌验证

> Provenance: `[LEGACY_PROVENANCE_UNKNOWN]` humanReviewed: unknown; reviewer: pending; risk: historical release note predates explicit provenance policy

将目标质量门内化为 Agent 内嵌逻辑，实现零进程开销验证。与 v0.5.2 的 agent_context_policy 一脉相承：Agent 模式不能只是"不调 API"，还必须把任务边界收窄成可直接执行的闭合上下文包。

### Added

- `scripts/goal-validator.mjs`：可内嵌的纯函数，5 维度目标质量验证（可交付物、可验证性、时间边界、范围边界、责任归属）+ PIES-min 四关检验（案例关、模板关、决策关、反馈关）。
- `/api/goal/validate` 和 `/api/goal/create` 接入 dashboard_server（用于人工调试，不建议 Agent 循环中调用）。
- `npm run goal:validate` 入口（仅 CLI 调试用）。
- Action plan artifact 生成时自动注入四关检验结果、验收条件提取、 Judgment Closure 骨架。

### Changed

- `goal-validator.mjs` 重写为纯函数（`validate(text)`），设计为直接内嵌 Agent 上下文，不新建进程，不扫描文件系统。CLI 模式仅用于人工调试。
- `docs/JUDGMENT-CLOSURE-RULE.md` 升级到 0.6.0：新增 5 维度验证 + 四关检验 + Agent 模式内嵌执行约束（禁止新建进程、禁止全项目扫描）。
- `docs/AGENT_ENTRY.md` 新增 `/goal` 照妖镜入口质量门章节，说明 5 维度 + 四关 + Agent 执行约束。

### Design Notes

- 5 维度验证解决"用户说不清楚自己要什么"问题（照妖镜）；四关检验解决"概念无法落地"问题（PIES-min）。两者层次不同，先过 5 维度，再跑四关。
- 四关有任意一关失败 → 目标仍可继续分析，但 artifact 元数据需标注"四关未全过，素材待验证"，不进 approved 状态。

## 0.5.2 — Agent Context Budget

> Provenance: `[LEGACY_PROVENANCE_UNKNOWN]` humanReviewed: unknown; reviewer: pending; risk: historical release note predates explicit provenance policy

Reduce OpenClaw / Agent mode intelligence spend by making V8 agent tasks self-contained and explicitly bounded.

### Added

- `agent_context_policy` in `config/methods.json` to define closed task packs, allowed reads, forbidden project areas, and read budget.
- Agent queue envelopes now embed `source_text`, persona stance, required sections, audit headings, and output targets.
- Agent queue envelopes now include `context_policy.allowed_reads`, `write_targets`, `forbidden_globs`, and a stop rule for missing context.
- Documentation for OpenClaw context budgeting in `docs/AGENT_ENTRY.md`, `docs/openclaw-integration.md`, and `submissions/agent-queue/README.md`.

## 0.5.1 — Execution Mode Guard

> Provenance: `[LEGACY_PROVENANCE_UNKNOWN]` humanReviewed: unknown; reviewer: pending; risk: historical release note predates explicit provenance policy

Fix V8 analysis startup and mode switching so persona configuration remains parseable and agent mode does not spend API tokens.

### Fixed

- Restored `config/methods.json` to valid JSON with one stable persona schema and no duplicated top-level persona fields.
- Escaped the V8.2.1 persona wording so JSON parsing no longer fails before analysis starts.
- Made `scripts/run_v8_analysis.mjs` read `execution_mode` and skip API calls in `agent` mode.
- Added `--mode` / `--execution-mode` overrides for one-off API or Agent runs.
- Hardened CLI parsing for `--persona v8.2-dimension-radar`, `--persona=v8.2-dimension-radar`, and `-p v8.2-dimension-radar`.

## 0.3.6 — Judgment Closure

> Provenance: `[LEGACY_PROVENANCE_UNKNOWN]` humanReviewed: unknown; reviewer: pending; risk: historical release note predates explicit provenance policy
